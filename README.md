Wow Addon Updater

## (planned) features

- lightweight, pretty, native and fast cli, alike `yay`/`paru`
- search, install, remove or update your addons from multiple providers (`curse`, `wowinterface`, `github`, etc), for multiple flavors (`retail`, `classic`, custom servers, etc), and multiple release channels (`release`, `beta`, `git`, etc)
